This is a a simple forum based on php mysql that can be used to make registration, login and post queries etc which is visible to all users.

To run simply put this code in a folder in your xampp/wamp server and edit the file convars.php, make changes to these lines only
$DB_USER = "root"; //change to mysql user
$DB_PASSWORD = "password"; //chnage mysql password here

after this import the file sql_queries.sql to to your mysql database.

Default login id is 'admin' and password is 'admin123'

Please note that this is a very basic project which has practically no use and can only be used for demonstration and as a school project.
